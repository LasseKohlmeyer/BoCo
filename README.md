* Raw data is the original data set from SoCi Survey
* Book familarity contains a mapping of IDs to book descriptions (title, author) and familarity scores
* Triangulation Raw contains for each participant and each triplet-facet combination the decisions
* Human assessed contains the majority decisions and agreement scores for all triplet-facet combinations
* Self assessed contains for combination with a small agreement self assessed values, which can be used as tie breakers
* Human assessed complete contains the decisions from both, human assessed and self assessed

To use the data sets the files book familarity and human assessed complete are sufficient.
